## SQL Interview Question 66

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Amazon SQL Interview Question</bold>

Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values.
Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month.

A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year. Assume each month has at least one purchase.

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE amazon_purchases ( created_at DATETIME, purchase_amt BIGINT, user_id BIGINT);

INSERT INTO amazon_purchases (created_at, purchase_amt, user_id) VALUES ('2023-01-05', 1500, 101), ('2023-01-15', -200, 102), ('2023-02-10', 2000, 103), ('2023-02-20', 1200, 101), ('2023-03-01', 1800, 104), ('2023-03-15', -100, 102), ('2023-04-05', 2200, 105), ('2023-04-10', 1400, 103), ('2023-05-01', 2500, 106), ('2023-05-15', 1700, 107), ('2023-06-05', 1300, 108), ('2023-06-15', 1900, 109);
```

#### Expected Output

| YearMonth | RollingAvgRevenue |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 2023-01   | 1500.0000         |
| 2023-02   | 2350.0000         | 
| 2023-03   | 2166.6667         |
| 2023-04   | 2866.6667         |
| 2023-05   | 3200.0000         |
| 2023-06   | 3666.6667         |
