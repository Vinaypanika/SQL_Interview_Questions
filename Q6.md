## SQL Interview Question 6

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Google SQL Interview Question</bold>

You are given a transaction table, which records transactions between sellers and buyers.
The structure of the table is as follows: 

| Column         | Data Type | Description                   |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Transaction_ID | INT       | Unique transaction identifier |
| Customer_ID    | INT       | Unique customer identifier    |
| Amount         | INT       | Transaction amount            |
| Date           | TIMESTAMP | Transaction date and time     |

Every successful transaction will have two row entries into the table with two different transaction_id but in ascending order sequence,
the first one for the seller where their customer_id will be registered, and the second one for the buyer where their customer_id will be registered.
The amount and date_time for both will however be the same. 

Write an sql query to find the 5 top seller-buyer combinations who have had maximum transactions between them. 

Condition - Please disqualify the sellers who have acted as buyers and also the buyers who have acted as sellers for this condition.

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount INT,
    tran_Date DATETIME
);

INSERT INTO Transactions (transaction_id, customer_id, amount, tran_Date) VALUES
(1, 101, 500, '2025-01-01 10:00:01'),
(2, 201, 500, '2025-01-01 10:00:01'),
(3, 102, 300, '2025-01-02 00:50:01'),
(4, 202, 300, '2025-01-02 00:50:01'),
(5, 101, 700, '2025-01-03 06:00:01'),
(6, 202, 700, '2025-01-03 06:00:01'),
(7, 103, 200, '2025-01-04 03:00:01'),
(8, 203, 200, '2025-01-04 03:00:01'),
(9, 101, 400, '2025-01-05 00:10:01'),
(10, 201, 400, '2025-01-05 00:10:01'),
(11, 101, 500, '2025-01-07 10:10:01'),
(12, 201, 500, '2025-01-07 10:10:01'),
(13, 102, 200, '2025-01-03 10:50:01'),
(14, 202, 200, '2025-01-03 10:50:01'),
(15, 103, 500, '2025-01-01 11:00:01'),
(16, 101, 500, '2025-01-01 11:00:01'),
(17, 203, 200, '2025-11-01 11:00:01'),
(18, 201, 200, '2025-11-01 11:00:01');
```

#### Expected Output

| Seller ID | Buyer ID | No. of Transactions |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| 102       | 202      | 2                   |
