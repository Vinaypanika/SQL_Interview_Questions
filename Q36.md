## SQL Interview Question 36

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Deloitte SQL Interview Question</bold>

Write a SQL query that transforms the data into a specific format. The output should display the names sorted alphabetically and organized under their corresponding occupations in separate columns.
Each row in the output should represent a unique position in the sorted list, and if there are fewer names for a particular occupation, the remaining cells should be filled with NULL.

#### Schema setup

```sql
-- Schema Setup
CREATE TABLE occupation (
    name VARCHAR(20),
    occup VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO occupation (name, occup) VALUES
('samantha', 'doctor'),
('julia', 'actor'),
('maria', 'actor'),
('meera', 'singer'),
('ashely', 'professor'),
('ketty', 'professor'),
('christeen', 'professor'),
('jane', 'actor'),
('jenny', 'doctor'),
('priya', 'singer');
```

#### Expected Output

| Actor  | Doctor   | Professor | Singer |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| Jane   | Jenny   | Ashely     | Meera  |
| Julia  | Samantha | Christeen | Priya  |
| Maria  | NULL    | Ketty      | NULL   |
