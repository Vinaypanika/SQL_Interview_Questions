## SQL Interview Question 13

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Meta SQL Interview Question</bold>

The "famous" table contains two columns: user_id and follower_id.
It represents the follower relationships among users, where each follower_id is also a user on the platform.  

Calculate the famous percentage for each user using the formula:  
Famous Percentage = (Number of followers a user has) / (Total number of users on the platform)

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE famous (user_id INT, follower_id INT);

INSERT INTO famous VALUES
(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), 
(11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 5), (13, 10), 
(14, 12), (14, 3), (15, 14), (15, 13);
```

#### Expected Output

| user_id | famous_percentage |
|---------|-------------------|
| 1       | 15.38462          |
| 2       | 7.69231           | 
| 5       | 15.38462          |
| 11      | 7.69231           |
| 12      | 7.69231           |
| 13      | 15.38462          |
| 14      | 15.38462          |
| 15      | 15.38462          |
