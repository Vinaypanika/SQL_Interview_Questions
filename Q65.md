## SQL Interview Question 65

#### Problem Statement

<bold>Meta SQL Interview Question</bold>

The sales department has given you the sales figures for the first two months of 2023.

You've been tasked with determining the percentage of weekly sales on the first and last day of every week. Consider Sunday as last day of week and Monday as first day of week.
In your output, include the week number, percentage sales for the first day of the week, and percentage sales for the last day of the week. Both proportions should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

#### Schema setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE early_sales ( invoicedate DATETIME, invoiceno BIGINT, quantity BIGINT, stockcode NVARCHAR(50), unitprice FLOAT);

INSERT INTO early_sales (invoicedate, invoiceno, quantity, stockcode, unitprice) VALUES ('2023-01-01 10:00:00', 1001, 5, 'A001', 20.0), ('2023-01-01 15:30:00', 1002, 3, 'A002', 30.0), ('2023-01-02 09:00:00', 1003, 10, 'A003', 15.0), ('2023-01-02 11:00:00', 1004, 2, 'A004', 50.0), ('2023-01-08 10:30:00', 1005, 4, 'A005', 25.0), ('2023-01-08 14:45:00', 1006, 7, 'A006', 18.0), ('2023-01-15 08:00:00', 1007, 6, 'A007', 22.0), ('2023-01-15 16:00:00', 1008, 8, 'A008', 12.0), ('2023-01-22 09:30:00', 1009, 3, 'A009', 40.0), ('2023-01-22 18:00:00', 1010, 5, 'A010', 35.0), ('2023-02-01 10:00:00', 1011, 9, 'A011', 20.0), ('2023-02-01 12:00:00', 1012, 2, 'A012', 60.0), ('2023-02-05 09:30:00', 1013, 4, 'A013', 25.0), ('2023-02-05 13:00:00', 1014, 6, 'A014', 18.0), ('2023-02-12 10:00:00', 1015, 7, 'A015', 22.0), ('2023-02-12 14:00:00', 1016, 5, 'A016', 28.0);
